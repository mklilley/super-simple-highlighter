## What is it?
A Chrome extension for highlighting text, and automatically attempt to restore highlight on each page revisit.

## THIS IS A FORK

This is a fork of the original [Super Simple Highlighter](https://github.com/dexterouslogic/super-simple-highlighter). I made a small change (can be [viewed here](https://github.com/dexterouslogic/super-simple-highlighter/compare/master...mklilley:super-simple-highlighter:master)) which fixes a [problem](https://github.com/dexterouslogic/super-simple-highlighter/pull/17) when HTML IDs start with a number.
